# CaféX Live Assist BOT SDK
The CaféX Live Assist SDK provides a means for an automated chat endpoint (a bot) to escalate a conversation such that the visitor can interact with a (human) agent in CaféX Live Assist.

The SDK is designed to be used server-side in a .Net environment.

Once a bot has determined that it wants to put the visitor in touch with an agent, the SDK is employed and a call made to request a chat. Subsequent operation involves polling the SDK for data relating to the conversation. Thereafter the bot behaves as a relay between the visitor and the agent.
